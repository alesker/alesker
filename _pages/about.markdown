**Hi! ðŸ‘‹**

My name is Ilya Alesker and I am software developer from RigaðŸ‡±ðŸ‡» currently working at Pipedrive and based in TallinnðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ª.
I am 29 years old.

Over the last 10 years I've been doing mobile software development starting with Maemo and Meego, then Android, and eventually iOS.

In my spare time I am a huge cinema buff, hockey fan (Go Devils!) and ardent admirer of food.
I love cooking and after finishing high school I seriously entertained the idea of going to the culinary arts school and becoming a chef.
I chose software development, however, because programming was an interest of mine since early age, but sometimes I still wonder on what could have been...

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/evil_cormorant) to see me mostly ranting about hockey and gushing about cinema;
on [GitHub](https://github.com/alesker) to see some of my personal projects;
or on some other [social](https://instagram.com/evil_cormorant) [network](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyaalesker).
